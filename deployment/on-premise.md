### 2.  Configure preferences

Once the license has been selected, it is possible to customize the service with some preferences such as:

* **Admin Email**: this email address will be assigned for the administration of the private server. It will be the only one that will be able to register new users, domains, rebrandings, plugins etc.
* **Additional users**: Every private instance always has one user account, but this option allows to increase the amount of accounts in order to share the server with other collaborators or customers. However, note that the server could be overloaded if a large number of user accounts with plugins is added, affecting the proper functioning of the instance.
* **Extended Support**: This option is recommended in order to obtain Thinger.io engineers development support. It provides 24-48h response time, however all accounts can use the community discussion forum to obtain support from other community developers at: https://community.thinger.io
* **Custom Domains**: It is the amount of different web domains that can be redirected to the same Private Instance in order to create multiple rebrandings.
* **Custom Brands**: It is the amount of different console rebrandings that can be created over the same server. Each rebrand may have a different customization of colors, web-domain and logotypes.
