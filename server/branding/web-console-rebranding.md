# WEB CONSOLE REBRANDING

## Web Console Rebranding

Thinger.io instances support multi-tenant web console customizations. By means of a management tool that is available at the main menu "Rebranding" section, it is possible to create and manage multiple web customizations, in order to custom the aspect of the web console to different customers or projects by changing some elements such as:

* [x] Branding Colors
* [x] Web, Favicon and Main Menu logotypes
* [x] Links, Email accounts, copyright

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that each web console reband needs to be supported by an individual web domain, which can be managed in the "Domain" section of the main menu.
{% endhint %}

### Create a new Web Console Rebranding Profile

Clicking into "Add Brand" button of the "Rebranding" section, allows creating a new branding profile. The process starts by introducing a web domain name, that will be the identificator for the brand profile:

All the next elements are non-mandatory, so can be left empty and the system will remove their buttons from the main menu:

* **Domain Name:** Is the URL of the new rebranded web console. This Web Domain needs to be introduced in the system as is explained in the "Custom Web Domain" section. 
* **Description:** Place here some additional information about the rebranding profile in order to identify it from the others.
* **Page title:** Identificator for the web browser tabs
* **Page URL:** To introduce link to the company, customer or project website
* **Company Name:** Name of the project, customer or company this rebranding belongs to. 
* **Contact Email:** address for the main menu"Email" button ****that the users are going to contact for support.
* **Twitter Account:**  Social media profile can be added by placing here the complete URL of the twitter profile.
* **Copyright:** The bottom of the website includes a copyright declaration that can be customized here to protect the rebranding rights.  

### Custom Logotypes

What really makes the difference when creating a rebranding is the use of custom logotypes. The second section of the branding editor allows changing each web console logotype separately. To obtain nice results, it is important to take care about the background color of each logotype in order to obtain enough contrast.
