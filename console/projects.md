# PROJECTS

A "Project" on Thinger.io is an abstract concept created to create resources agrupations \(devices, dashboards, buckets, endpoints or file systems\) allowing better management of their data and configuration. The project system also allows to share these resources with other user accounts of the same Thinger.io Platform Instance, allowing them to access, show or use other user resources according to certain permissions. This means that we can authorize other users to work with our account resources as if there were their proprietaries or just with read-only access, depending on the permissions that were managed.  

## Creating new project

To start working with projects, go to the main menu and click into the `Projects` tab, getting access to the projects list. Then press the `Add project`button that will open the new project definition form as shown in the image below:

The form parameters will help to identify the project. Onces that the form is completed with appropriate values, pressing the `Add project`button will create the new project profile that will not be shared by any other user. This way it can be used to organize the resources of different projects, allowing easy navigation when working with large networks, just using the projects navigation menu, on the workspace top bar:

After creating a new project it will not be selected by default, so before start creating resources, the little folder icon of the top bar must be pressed in order to select the desired one.

### Adding project members

Ones a new project profile has been created, it is possible to include project members with which all resources will be shared according to specific authorizations provided by the project creator. To start adding members, open the configuration menu by pressing project's identificator on the list, then press into the blue `Project Members` button as shown in the image below:

This will open the projects member list, in which the user accounts that belong to the same project will be displayed allowing to modify permissions in the future. It will be empty the first time we access to an recently created project as shown in the image below:

To include the first member, just press the green `Add Member` button, that will open the next form, allowing to introduce the user account identificator and permission preferences:

#### permission managing

-Permisos individuales--&gt;Los permisos se asocian al tipo de recurso \(ver devices, editar dashboards, descargar buckets....\) no se puede dar diferentes permisos a dos recursos de un mismo tipo. 

### Creating project resources 

-No se puede asociar un recurso a un project despu√©s de haber sido creado \(por el momento al menos\)

### Modifying project resources

delete: -El borrado elimina el recurso de ambas cuentas
